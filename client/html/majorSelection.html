              <h4>What is a Software Engineering (SE) major?</h4>
              <p>This major qualifies you to become a software engineer, encompassing various branches such as web
                development, mobile
                development, cloud architecture, some DevOps, software testing, and more. Primarily, you'll be tasked
                with
                implementing
                features or enhancing system performance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>When should you choose it?</h4>
              <p>If you have a passion for coding, debugging, Learning new things, and innovating new features. Over
                time,
                you might find
                it more methodical than creative, but it remains enjoyable through continuous exploration.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Is it worth majoring in?</h4>
              <p>It depends on your aspirations. Becoming a proficient software engineer demands significant effort,
                making it
                impractical as a minor due to time constraints, especially with project commitments. If you are
                interested
                in having
                more practical projects and experience in different stacks, this is for you.</p>

          Personal insight:
          For some, pursuing ML outside of university might be more efficient and manageable, though individual

              <h4>What is a Data Science (DS) major?</h4>
              <p>This major qualifies you to become a data scientist, encompassing various branches such as data
                visualization, data
                engineering, data analysis, database optimization, big data, data pipelining, image processing, machine
                learning,
                advanced machine learning, and more. Primarily, you'll be tasked to deal with data for different
                purposes such as
                answering a research question, making a efficient machine learning model, optimizing database queries
                for faster
                retrival, dealing with different databases, and more.</p>

                pointing out insights,
                and innovating new features. As it remains practical, tasks could get repetitive over time, but it
                remains a field of
                interest and it puts you on the road of playing around with data in various ways. It may shift your

                IT security,
                where there are a lot of different tools to use and discover, data science is more limited with tools
                and focuses on
                data and general concepts.</p>

                But If Dr. Amal Abdelkarim happens to be the instructor for the course, I would suggest considering
                alternatives. Based on my personal experience, her teaching style may not align with everyone's
                preferences. When weighing between majors, like Data Science and others, it's beneficial to prioritize
                courses led by instructors who are known for their effectiveness.

                tho doesn't
                delve too much into these tools. You learn about each tool in ONE or max TWO Labs, and then you move on.
                If you are

                typically you will have to learn about .pcap files and Wireshark kda kda. You will learn about how the
                forensics process
                works and what to do in it, then you will learn about the types of digital evidence and how to infer

                happened. Other than those, it is up for that Dr.</td>

              <h4>When to choose it?</h4>
              <p>first of all, no one can decide for you, no one.

                - but if you have a huge problem in programming this is the least programming heavy one (the least,
                doesn’t mean none, they all have a lot, it is just in less frequent amount, also no problem can’t be
                fixed and ***you should fix it***).
                - you have a knack for fiddling with the src code of any software you touch.
                - you like learning , you will do a lot of that! Constantly and consistently and you have to love it.
                - It is creativity heavy. meaning that thinking outside of the box is the norm (yup) and that you will
                always have to push to your limits to solve a certain problem whether in real life during your job or in
                the learning phase (solving CTFs or vulnerable machines).
                Doesn’t mean if you think you are not creative then it is not for you. creativity either stems naturally
                or from experience or both akeed. pick your poison.
                - If you liked the ECPC competitions, we have that too but they are called CTF competitions. Basically
                you hack for fun and to win the competitions which also have prizes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>When not to</h4>
              <p>- Job opportunities in Egypt overall are not the best but in security. It is the lowest but they are
                all great companies. Think about it like: either you won’t get a job or you will get an amazing one, no
                in-between (at least not yet).
                - It is extremely stressful. To be great at it, you have to keep studying and keep working, you can’t
                just stop and use what you already learnt, you just can’t, or you will be average. For example a React
                Dev would just keep learning all there is to know industry wise about react (so he is learning
                vertically), when he does need to expand his knowledge about other domains he just goes for another
                javascript framework masalan msh learning about graphql and SEO masalan (btw he is doing that while
                working a 9 to 5 job and has a life). in security no you have to learn horizontally more and when you
                need to learn vertically.
                - you hate networks and OS
                - you don’t like just nitpicking or fiddling or just trying every single option there is to reach some
                “goal” . some problems require one path only to solve it, so you would have to bruteforce all other
                options.</p>

            <li><span>Machine Learning:</span> is an amazing option to pick, to have the combo of applying machine
              learning in
              security.<b> If you don’t
              take machine learning in semester 5, you can’t take advanced machine learning in semester 6.<b>
            </li>
            <li><span>software construction:</span> is both theoretical and highly practical so you will have a course
              you are a bit
              familiar with and
              also get to understand software applications a bit more.</li>
            <li><span>software architecture:</span> pick it if you don’t want any datascience courses (theory heavy) and
              not worth it
              as a security
              major but if you want to secure a backup plan for a software career or a software interelated with
              security career
              (there are a lot of those and they are AWESOME). go for it</li>
            <li><span>Database programming:</span> is not worth it at all, pick it if you are bored or you want to get
              all datascience
              electives</li>
            <li><span>Data visualization:</span>is a fun easy course but there are better options to pick and you can
              get the
              knowledge elsewhere</li>

            <h4>Semester 6 (read it now not when you reach semester 5 lol)</h4>
            <li><span>advanced ML:</span>take it if you already took ML.also don’t take ML if you are not gonna take advanced !!!!!</li>
            <li><span>Big Data:</span>is a super fun course and a nice knowledge to have . disregard the UNI’s warning
              about it being a heavy course . but it
              doesn’t have lectures it is only 2 labs per week so if you hate attendance issues yah…..</li>
            <li><span>mobile development:</span><i>personal opinion:</i> I wouldn't recommend selecting it if Dr. Amal
              is the one teaching it,but just don’t for your sake</li>
            <li><span>cloud computing:</span>AWESOME COURSE, YOU MUST TAKE IT AND YOU WILL NEED THAT KNOWLEDGE.</li>
            <li><span>image processing:</span>as a course is meh and don’t forget that you are an InfoSec student so pick extra
              skills or have fun or get an easy A+ course not a random course that could make you miserable.</li>
