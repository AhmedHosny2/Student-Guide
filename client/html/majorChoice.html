              <h4>What is a Software Engineering (SE) major?</h4>
              <p>This major qualifies you to become a software engineer, encompassing various branches such as web
                development, mobile
                development, cloud architecture, some DevOps, software testing, and more. Primarily, you'll be tasked
                with
                implementing
                features or enhancing system performance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>When should you choose it?</h4>
              <p>If you have a passion for coding, debugging, Learning new things, and innovating new features. Over
                time,
                you might find
                it more methodical than creative, but it remains enjoyable through continuous exploration.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Is it worth majoring in?</h4>
              <p>It depends on your aspirations. Becoming a proficient software engineer demands significant effort,
                making it
                impractical as a minor due to time constraints, especially with project commitments. If you are
                interested
                in having
                more practical projects and experience in different stacks, this is for you.</p>

          Personal insight:
          For some, pursuing ML outside of university might be more efficient and manageable, though individual

              <h4>What is a Data Science (DS) major?</h4>
              <p>This major qualifies you to become a data scientist, encompassing various branches such as data
                visualization, data
                engineering, data analysis, database optimization, big data, data pipelining, image processing, machine
                learning,
                advanced machine learning, and more. Primarily, you'll be tasked to deal with data for different
                purposes such as
                answering a research question, making a efficient machine learning model, optimizing database queries
                for faster

                pointing out insights,
                and innovating new features. As it remains practical, tasks could get repetitive over time, but it
                remains a field of
                interest and it puts you on the road of playing around with data in various ways. It may shift your
                career a bit to be

              <p>Being a data scientist is a more specific major in computer science, so unlike software engineering and
                IT security,
                where there are a lot of different tools to use and discover, data science is more limited with tools
                and focuses on

                recognition. Detecting moving objects in videos and so on.
                <br>
                The course itself is very interesting!
                <br>
                BUT if Dr. Amal Abdelkarim will teach the course, i advise against taking this course, because she is
                the worst dr i
                have ever met in my entire life. So if you are between choosing majors. (Data science or something
                else), my advice is
                take the course with the best Drs.

                Big Data itself (the field, not the course) is a very important and interesting field. The course itself
                tho doesn't
                delve too much into these tools. You learn about each tool in ONE or max TWO Labs, and then you move on.
                If you are
                interested in Big Data, you should definitely try to learn more on your own (at home) because the course
                wont teach you
                much. No midterm, only a final that mostly tests memorized code.

                is teaching it,
                typically you will have to learn about .pcap files and Wireshark kda kda. You will learn about how the
                forensics process
                works and what to do in it, then you will learn about the types of digital evidence and how to infer
                from it what
                happened. Other than those, it is up for that Dr.</td>

            <li><span>Machine Learning:</span> is an amazing option to pick, to have the combo of applying machine
              learning in
              security. If you don’t
              take machine learning in semester 5, you can’t take advanced machine learning in semester 6.
            </li>
            <li><span>software construction:</span> is both theoretical and highly practical so you will have a course
              you are a bit
              familiar with and
              also get to understand software applications a bit more.</li>
            <li><span>software architecture:</span> pick it if you don’t want any datascience courses (theory heavy) and
              not worth it
              as a security
              major but if you want to secure a backup plan for a software career or a software interelated with
              security career
              (there are a lot of those and they are AWESOME)</li>
            <li><span>Database programming:</span> is not worth it at all, pick it if you are bored or you want to get
              all datascience
              electives</li>
            <li><span>Data visualization:</span> is a fun easy course but there are better options to pick and you can
              get the
              knowledge elsewhere</li>
          </ul>

            <h4>Semester 6 (read it now not when you reach semester 5 lol)</h4>
            <li><span>advanced ML:</span>if you took ML , don’t take ML if you are not gonna take advanced !!!!!</li>
            <li><span>Big Data:</span>is a super fun course and a nice knowledge to have . disregard the UNI’s warning
              about it being a heavy course . but it
              doesn’t have lectures it is only 2 labs per week so if you hate attendance issues yah…..</li>
            <li><span>mobile development:</span>DON’T PICK IT WITH DR AMAL, just don’t for your sake</li>
            <li><span>cloud computing:</span>AWESOME COURSE, YOU MUST TAKE IT AND YOU NEED THAT KNOWLEDGE.</li>
            <li><span>image processing:</span>is meh and don’t forget that you are an IT sec student so pick extra
              skills or have fun or get an easy A+ course .</li>
